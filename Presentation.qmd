## Background {.smaller auto-animate=true}

### Risk

- Risk is a fundamental part of life
   - Different based on domain
      - Financial, Health, Social, etc. [@weber2002]
   - Differences based on perspective
      - Risky vs. Safe
      - Loss vs. Gain
      - Certainty vs. Uncertainty

## Studyal Design {.smaller auto-animate=true}

- 111 participants on Prolific completed the Study
   - Majority white yet with equal men and women
   - Completed either A-levels or undergraduate degrees

## Hypotheses {.smaller auto-animate=true}

- H1: Dominance will be positively associated with belief in risk positivity/benefit
- H2: Prestige will not be related to risk positivity/benefit
- H3: Leadership will be weakly negatively related to risk positivity/benefit
- H4: No unique relationship between DoPL motives and general risk perception
- H5: Males will be more risk-prone than females for financial risk-taking/acceptance [@franco2011]
- H6: A general positive relationship between unique dominance and sub-domains of risk-taking/acceptance


## Results {.smaller auto-animate=true}

   - H1: Increasing levels of dominance motivation predicted a more positive perception of the overall benefit of risk behaviors ($\beta$ = 0.26, 95% HDI = [0.08, 0.46]])
   - H2: Prestige did not predict precpetions of risk benefit ($\beta$ = 0.15, 95% HDI = [-0.05, 0.34])
   - H3: Leadership was not predictive risk benefit perception ($\beta$ = -0.09, 95% HDI = [-0.27, 0.09]])
   - H4: There was no relationship between either prestige or Leadership motives, there was a negative relationship with dominance, with stronger dominance predicting decreased perception of risk as risky ($\beta$ = -0.28, 95% HDI = [-0.49, -0.09])
   - H5: Failed to replicate asymmetry between men and women in willingness to take financial risk ($\beta$ = -0.30, 95% HDI = [-0.66, 0.07])
   - H6: Data support of the predictive ability of dominance, most strongly for the recreation sub-domain, followed by health/safety, ethical, social, and finally financial risk

## Study 1 Discussion

- An overall support of our predictions
- Dominance appeared as the strongest predictor across all sub-domains of DOSPERT
- The obvious limitations
   - White, English-speaking, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) sample
- Correlational research and the possibility of a third variable
   - Narcissism??

## Goals of Study 2

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50% .fragment}
- Replicate findings of study 1
- Investigate the relationship between risk and power motivations with narcissism
- Investigate dominance as a moderator of the relationship between risk and power motivations

## Results {.smaller auto-animate=true}

- H1: Dominance will be positively associated with belief in risk positivity/benefit
- H2: Prestige will not be related to risk-benefit
- H3: Leadership will not be related to risk-benefit
- H4: A positive relationship between unique dominance and subdomains of risk-taking/acceptance
- H5: DoPL will be positively zero-order correlated with, both zero-order and narcissism (B-PNI)
- H6: Narcissism will be positively associated with DOSPERT sub-domains

## Results {.smaller auto-animate=true}

- H1: Higher dominance motive scores again predicted the benefit of risky behaviors evaluated more positively ($\beta$ = 0.28, 95% HDI = [0.17, 0.38])
- H2: Prestige motive didn't predict the benefit of risky behaviors ($\beta$ = -0.02, 95% HDI = [-0.13, 0.08])
- H3: Leadership motive had no unique relationship with risk-benefit ($\beta$ = 0.0, 95% HDI = [-0.10, 0.10])
- H4: Dominance-motivated people  had stronger preferences for all sub-domains of risk-taking (table in next slide)
- H5: Partial support of positive correlations between B-PNI and DoPL motives
- H6: No unique relationship between B-PNI and any of the sub-domains of DOSPERT

## Discussion

- Dominance motive was the strongest predictor of risk-taking
- Dominance is also a strong moderator of effects when introducing pathological narcissism
- Same limitations overall
- Future directions
   - Look at sexual experiences and risk-taking + DoPL
      - In progress
